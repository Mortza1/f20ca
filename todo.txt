currently, we are just sending the current message to the bot, not the whole text history. This helps latency,  but we loose context. Also,
we can dynamically update the prompt to have the context of the current calender, current date, and nearby reservations. This will avoid the use
of tool calling, increasing the overall latency. 

Each booking requires capturing a full name, car detail, problem with the car,  and the date and time user is comfortable with. 

so let us complete the booking system first, before we go off improving our latency system.

right, so the naive version waits for audio to complete, save the file and then run the vad on it. that makes no sense. We will 
have the audio bytes streamed  and used directly by VAD.
