right so I am using speech brain and everything is happening in batches... the overall latency is at 30s. this is bad but atleast this is functional.
on three to  and fros, it came down  to 17s.

so i updated the model to be hot loaded once the server starts, and the first interaction came down to 16s instead of starting at 30s. So progress, i guess.

I changed the tts from speech brain to eleven labs via puter, and latency dropped to like 7s and the audio quality is waaaay good...


okkkk... so i am using eleven labs stt, and it is around 2.5s now

added vad,  updated the booking system, we are now at 2.5 - 3s range,  here is the breakdown.. 
INFO:__main__:Total backend latency: 2849.65ms (conversion: 781.35ms + VAD: 385.49ms + trim: 62.28ms + ASR: 697.25ms + LLM: 920.95ms + overhead: 2.34ms)

ofc, the next obvious improvement is at conversion by streaming our responses.
